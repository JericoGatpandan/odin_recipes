    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li> ¼ cup water, or more to taste</li>

        <li>3 tablespoons lime juice</li>

        <li>3 tablespoons fish sauce</li>

        <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar, or more to taste</li>

        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root</li>

        <li>½ teaspoon Sriracha chile sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Whisk water, lime juice, fish sauce, brown sugar, garlic, ginger, and Sriracha together in a bowl until the sugar is dissolved.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of water to a full boil; remove from heat and soak rice noodles in the hot water for 1 minute. Stir to separate the noodles and continue soaking until the noodles are tender, about 3 minutes more. Drain noodles and rinse with cold water until cooled. Shake noodles in colander to drain as much water as possible.
        </li>
        <li>
            Mix noodles, cabbage, carrots, shrimp, bean sprouts, cucumber slices, green onions, mint, cilantro, and basil together in a large bowl. Drizzle the dressing over the salad and toss to coat. Top with chopped peanuts.
