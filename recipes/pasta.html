    <p>A versatile Italian staple made from durum wheat flour, water, and sometimes eggs. It comes in various shapes and
        sizes, such as spaghetti, penne, and fettuccine, and can be served with a variety of sauces and toppings</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages fat-free cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li> 3 ½ tablespoons prepared horseradish</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Dijon-style mustard</li>
        <li> 12 (12 inch) flour tortillas</li>
        <li> 30 spinach leaves, washed with stems removed</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds thinly sliced cooked deli roast beef</li>
        <li>8 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat the cream cheese, horseradish, and mustard together in a bowl until well blended.</li>
        <li>
            Spread a thin layer of the cream cheese mixture over each tortilla. Arrange spinach leaves evenly over the
            tortillas. Place two slices of roast beef over the cream cheese. Sprinkle with Cheddar cheese, dividing
            evenly between tortillas. Starting at one end, gently roll up each tortilla into a tight tube. Wrap with
            aluminum foil or plastic wrap to keep the rolls tight. Refrigerate at least 4 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            To serve for lunch, unwrap and slice into 2 or 3 pieces. Only cut the rolls you will be using that day so
            the others do not dry out. To serve for parties, unwrap and slice the rolls diagonally into 1 inch sections,
            and arrange on a serving platter.
        </li>
    </ol>
